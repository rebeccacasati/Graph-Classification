This code was developed for the AI Models for Physics of the Masteer's Degree in Artificial Intelligence for Science and Technology.

In this project (binary) graph classification is performed on three datasets selected from the TUDataset collection, using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network implemented with PyTorch Geometric (Graph_Classification_PyG.ipynb) and with Deep Graph Library (Graph_Classification_DGL.ipynb).
